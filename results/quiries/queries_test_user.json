Do you have any trains into Cambridge today?\n[USER]I would like to leave from Kings Lynn after 9:30.\n[USER]Can you give me the price of a ticket?\n[USER]Great I also need to find a place to stay that doesn't need to have free parking and is in the cheap price range.\n[USER]Cheap price range in the centre.\n[USER]I will take Alexander please.\n[USER]Yes. Please book it for 2 people for 2 nights on Sunday.\n[USER]Actually, let's back up. I need a place with a star rating of 0, in the centre, with free parking. Does the Alexander have 0 stars?\n[USER]Yes, that would work for me. Please book it for 2 people for 2 nights starting sunday.\n[USER]How about trying just for one night, instead?\n[USER]No, that will be all.  Thank you for all of your help!"
